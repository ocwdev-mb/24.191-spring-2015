## Instructor Insights

{{< quote "Almost all MIT students want to make a difference in the world, but many are not quite sure how to go about it. They´re overwhelmed by the task and they´re not sure how to start. We designed the course to help students identify small changes they can make in their everyday lives that will help them actualize the difference they hope to see." "—Patricia-Maria Weinmann" >}}
