"Choose Your Own Adventure" Reflection: 6 Minutes to a Topic Round-robin

_The idea is to give you an opportunity both (a) to discuss further any issues or questions raised in previous classes (or events you've attended for reflections) that have been lingering in your mind, and (b) to discuss any ethical / political /cultural issues you are passionate about that haven't yet been covered in the class._
